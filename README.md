# DataNexus: A Decentralized Dataset Collaboration Platform
DataNexus is a Web3 platform that allows users to upload, contribute to, and verify datasets, earning DATA tokens for their work. It creates a decentralized marketplace for high-quality, community-vetted data.

## Key Features & Project Pages
### 1. Main Dashboard
